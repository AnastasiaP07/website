PhD Position Title: Studying exoplanet atmospheres with JWST.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Position details: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is transforming our understanding of planets beyond our Solar System. With its unparalleled ability to peer into distant atmospheres, JWST has opened a new era in exoplanet science. Yet, small rocky worlds and sub-Neptunes continue to push the boundaries of what this remarkable instrument can reveal. In this project, the PhD candidate will delve into the modeling and analysis of transitional exoplanets observed with JWST. Depending on your interests and skills, your work may range from developing advanced data reduction and calibration tools to building atmospheric interpretation and retrieval models that decode the nature of these mysterious worlds. Applicants with a background in mathematics, physics (including astro.), computer science, or engineering are encouraged to apply.
