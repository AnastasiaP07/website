Anastasia is a third year Astronomy student at the University of Groningen. She currently has an interest in exoplanets, and will be pursuing a bachelor thesis in the topic. The main goal of her research is establishing criteria for suitable exoplanet target selection, with the purpose of atmospheric analysis using the eclipse method. This project is in its very early stages, with Anastasia focusing on the last few courses of her bachelor, as well as working as a teacher assistant. She is also very interested in exploring other fields of research and making valuable connections to aid with her academic orientation.
