Giacomo is a first-year PhD student at the University of Groningen.
He is insterested in exoplanet atmospheres, in particular in their weather and how it can be modeled and recovered from observations, both from current telescopes like JWST, and in preparation for future missions like Ariel.
He is especially interested in how to make use of all the data that is present in phase curve observations.
